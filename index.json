You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-751638942', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

During arousal from torpor, both metabolic rate and body temperature rapidly returns to resting levels. Metabolic rate reduction experienced by torpid animals is triggered by active suppression of mitochondrial respiration, which is rapidly reversed during rewarming process. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the maximal activity of key enzymes related to electron transport system (complexes I, III and IV) in six tissues of torpid, arousing and euthermic Chilean mouse-opossums (*Thylamys elegans*). We observed higher maximal activities of complexes I and IV during torpor in brain, heart and liver, the most metabolically active organs in mammals. On the contrary, higher enzymatic activities of complexes III were observed during torpor in kidneys and lungs. Moreover, skeletal muscle was the only tissue without significant differences among stages in all complexes evaluated, suggesting no modulation of oxidative capacities of electron transport system components in this thermogenic tissue. In overall, our data suggest that complexes I and IV activity plays a major role in initiation and maintenance of metabolic suppression during torpor in Chilean mouse-opossum, whereas improvement of oxidative capacities in complex III might be critical to sustain metabolic machinery in organs that remains metabolically active during torpor.","tags":["Torpor","Marsupials","Electron transport system"],"title":"Mitochondrial phenotype during torpor: Modulation of mitochondrial electron transport system in the Chilean mouse–opossum Thylamys elegans","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Although ecological characteristics facilitating the establishment and spread of non-native species are widely recognized, little is known about organismal attributes underlying invasion success. In this study, we tested the effect of thermal acclimation on thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in the invasive *Xenopus laevis* and the Chilean native *Calyptocephalella gayi*. In particular, the maximal righting performance (μMAX), optimal temperature (TO), lower (CTmin) and upper critical thermal limits (CTmax), thermal breadth (Tbr) and the area under the performance curve (AUC) were studied after 6 weeks acclimation to 10 and 20°C. We observed higher values of μmax and AUC in *X. laevis* in comparison to *C. gayi*. On the contrary, the invasive species showed lower values of CTmin in comparison to the native one. In contrast, CTmax, TO and Tbr showed no inter-specific differences. Moreover, we found that both species have the ability to acclimate their locomotor performance and lower thermal tolerance limit at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that *X. laevis* is a better performer than *C. gayi*. Although there were differences in CTmin, the invasive and native frogs did not differ in their thermal tolerance. Interestingly, in both species the lower and upper critical thermal limits are beyond the minimal and maximal temperatures encountered in nature during the coldest and hottest month, respectively.

During arousal from torpor, organs undergo rapid metabolic reactivation and rewarming to near normal levels. As torpor progress, animals show a preference for fatty acids over glucose as primary source of energy. Here, we analyzed for first time the changes in the maximal activity of key enzymes related to fatty acid (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase and β-Hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) and carbohydrate (Pyruvate kinase, Phosphofructokinase and Lactate dehydrogenase) catabolism, as well as mitochondrial oxidative capacity (Citrate synthase), in six organs of torpid, arousing and euthermic Chilean mouse-opossums (*Thylamys elegans*). Our results showed that activity of enzymes related to fatty acid and carbohydrate catabolism were different among torpor phases and the pattern of variation differs among tissues. In terms of lipid utilization, maximal enzymatic activities differ in tissues with high oxidative capacity such as heart, kidney, and liver. In terms of carbohydrate use, lower enzymatic activities were observed during torpor in brain and liver. Interestingly, citrate synthase activity did not differ thought torpor-arousal cycle in any tissues analyzed, suggesting no modulation of mitochondrial content in T. elegans. Overall results provide an indication that modulation of enzymes associated with carbohydrate and fatty-acid pathways is mainly oriented to limit energy expensive processes and sustain energy metabolism during transition from torpor to euthermy. Future studies are required to elucidate if physiological events observed for *T. elegans* are unique from other marsupials, or represents a general response in marsupials.","tags":["Torpor","Marsupials","Fatty acid catabolism","Carbohydrate catabolism"],"title":"Mitochondrial phenotype of marsupial torpor: Fuel metabolic switch in the Chilean mouse-opossum Thylamys elegans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Cortés García","Magali Petit","Agnès Lewden","Myriam Milbergue","François Vézina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1424131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1424131200,"objectID":"d1665976d674b0867a814eb029fd5c93","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/2015_cortes-et-al/","publishdate":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_cortes-et-al/","section":"publication","summary":"Resident passerines inhabiting high latitude environments are faced with strong seasonal changes in thermal conditions and energy availability. Summit metabolic rate (maximal metabolic rate elicited by shivering during cold exposure M(sum)) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) vary in parallel among seasons and increase in winter due to cold acclimatization, and these adjustments are thought to be critical for survival. Wintering individuals expressing consistently higher M(sum) and BMR could therefore be seen as better performers with higher chances of winter survival than those exhibiting lower metabolic performance. In this study, we calculated repeatability to evaluate temporal consistency of body mass, BMR and M(sum) within and across three consecutives winters in black-capped chickadees (*Poecile atricapillus*). We found that body mass was significantly repeatable both within and across winters (R 0.51-0.90). BMR (R 0.29-0.47) was only repeatable within winter while M(sum) was repeatable both among (R 0.33-0.49) and within winters (R 0.33-0.49) with the magnitude and significance of repeatability in both variables depending on the year and whether they were corrected for body mass or body size. The patterns of repeatability observed among years also differed between the two variables.

Using 31 dead and 22 live chickadees, linear regressions between ultrasound and dissection measurements of pectoral and thigh muscles were fitted and compared between five different observers. R2 values varied greatly between observers and were generally weaker in live birds, ranging between 0.02 and 0.59, despite high repeatability of measurement. Using equations calculated from dead birds to estimate muscle mass of live birds yielded much higher measurement errors (9%–18%) than when using equations calculated from live birds (5%–8%).

In particular, we evaluated the effect of thermal acclimation on basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermal conductance (C) and torpor patterns, as well as the presence of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) as a rewarming mechanism in this marsupial. Non-significant effects of thermal acclimation were observed in BMR, C and body mass, but cold-acclimated individuals exhibited significantly longer torpor bouts. Also, minimum body temperature during torpor, inter-bout body temperature and arousal rewarming rate were lower in cold-acclimated animals. Furthermore, we found that *D. gliroides* did not display NST in response to Norepinephrine. Hence, despite the high regulation of torpor of other species, *D. gliroides* shows low flexibility in the ability to adjust energy expenditure and insulation properties, and (as in other marsupials) NST do not seems to be important as thermoregulatory mechanism.","tags":["Torpor","Thermal acclimation","Thermogenesis","Marsupial"],"title":" Thermoregulatory capacities and torpor in the South American marsupial, Dromiciops gliroides","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcela Franco","Carolina Contreras","Pablo Cortés García","Mark A.

In these conditions, energy-saving strategies are critical to reduce the energetic requirements for survival. Mammals from temperate regions show a wide arrange of such strategies, including torpor and huddling. Here we provide a quantitative description of thermoregulatory capacities and energy-saving strategies in *Dromiciops gliroides*, a Microbiotherid marsupial inhabiting temperate rain forests. Unlike many mammals from temperate regions, preliminary studies have suggested that this species has low capacity for control and regulation of body temperature, but there is still an incomplete picture of its bioenergetics. In order to more fully understand the physiological capacities of this “living fossil”, we measured its scope of aerobic power and the interaction between huddling and torpor. Specifically, we evaluated (1) the relation between basal (BMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and (2) the role of huddling on the characteristics of torpor at different temperatures. We found that BMR and MMR were above the expected values for marsupials and the factorial aerobic scope (from CO2) was 6.0±0.45 (using CO2) and 6.2±0.23 (using O2), an unusually low value for mammals. Also, repeatability of physiological variables was non-significant, as in previous studies, suggesting poor time-consistency of energy metabolism. Comparisons of energy expenditure and body temperature (using attached data-loggers) between grouped and isolated individuals showed that at 20°C both average resting metabolic rate and body temperature were higher in groups, essentially because animals remained non-torpid. At 10°C, however, all individuals became torpid and no differences were observed between grouped and isolated individuals. In summary, our study suggests that the main response of *Dromiciops gliroides* to low ambient temperature is reduced body temperature and torpor, irrespective of huddling. Low aerobic power and low time-consistency of most thermoregulatory traits of *Dromiciops gliroides* support the idea of poor thermoregulatory abilities in this species.","tags":["Torpor","Marsupials","Fatty acid catabolism","Carbohydrate catabolism"],"title":"Aerobic power, huddling and the efficiency of torpor in the South American marsupial, Dromiciops gliroides","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Cortés García","Marcela Franco","Pablo Sabat","Silvia A Quijano","Roberto F Nespolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1318723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1318723200,"objectID":"3b247489a5082f59a5f8894ec45cff5e","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/2011_cortes-et-al/","publishdate":"2011-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011_cortes-et-al/","section":"publication","summary":"The microbiotherid marsupial *Dromiciops gliroides* inhabits the temperate forests of the Southern hemisphere, facing seasonal nutritional and energetic bottlenecks due to its apparently facultative insectivory/frugivory.

However, as a response of diet acclimation, individuals showed several-fold changes in the activities of aminopeptidase-N, maltase and sucrase (but not trehalase). This result, both the magnitude of change and the simultaneous effects on three enzymes suggests that *D. gliroides* could exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the activity of intestinal enzymes.

Although resistance to insecticides provides important benefits for pests in agricultural fields that are treated with insecticides, it may be associated with fitness (or other) costs in environments that are insecticide free. In the present study, the fitness and energy costs that might be experienced by *M. persicae* in an insecticide-free environment when carrying at least one insecticide resistance mutation (IRM), or by having an increased production of esterases, are evaluated. The study investigates whether genotypes that have an IRM also have enhanced esterase production, whether there is any metabolic cost associated with insecticide resistance, and whether there are any fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance and metabolic expenditure. The intrinsic rate of increase, standard metabolic rate (i.e. a measure of maintenance costs) and constitutive esterase activity are determined for 30 different multilocus genotypes carrying (or not carrying) at least one of the two most frequent insecticide resistance mutations (MACE and kdr/super-kdr) that occur in Chile. The results show that genotypes carrying at least one IRM have higher levels of total esterase activity than genotypes without an IRM, that there is no evidence of an energy cost associated with total esterase activity or IRM, and no evidence for a reproductive fitness cost associated with total esterase activity, IRM or metabolic rate. The results agree with previous studies showing linkage disequilibrium between insecticide resistance mechanisms, although they contrast with those of studies that report fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance in *Myzus persicae*.","tags":["Reproductive fitness","Standard metabolic rate","Aphids","Energetic costs"],"title":"Evaluating reproductive fitness and metabolic costs for insecticide resistance in Myzus persicae from Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto F.

According to a recent exhaustive review by Secor (2009), studies in SDA are abundant, encompassing all kinds of vertebrates and invertebrates. However, important exceptions are arachnids, as few studies have characterized SDA in this group. Here, we measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the Chilean tarantulas *Euathlus truculentus* (body mass=7.32±0.7 g, N=32; T(A)=25°C), its inter-individual variation (i.e., repeatability) and its SDA. We measured SMR three or four times in each individual, and we also conducted predation experiments where a prey was consumed by each spider, during a respirometry trial. The SMR of *E. truculentus* was 0.00049±0.000079 mlCO(2) g(-1) min(-1) which corresponds to 1524 μW (assuming a protein-based diet), 108.4% of the predicted value for arachnids. According to the standard nomenclature for SDA studies, the scope of the SDA for a meal size of 1.26±0.04 g (18% of the spider size) was 6.55±1.1 times the baseline, the time to peak was 45 min, and the magnitude of the SDA was 0.28±0.03 kj, which is 85% of the expected value for invertebrates. Our SMR data are in concordance with previous findings suggesting remarkably low energy metabolism in arachnids, compared with other arthropods. On the other hand, the exceedingly high scope of the postprandial response contrasts with the comparatively low SDA. This fact suggests that spiders spend most of the energy for digestion in a short period after prey capture, which could be a consequence of their external digestion.","tags":["Specific dynamic action","Standard metabolic rate","Repeatability"],"title":"Energy metabolism and the postprandial response of the Chilean tarantulas, Euathlus truculentus (Araneae: Theraphosidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paulina Artacho","Christian C.

In aphids, different morphs, whether sexual or asexual, winged or wingless, are produced in response to specific environmental cues. The production of these morphs could imply a differential energy investment between the two reproductive phases (i.e., sexual and asexual), which can also be interpreted in terms of changes in genetic variation and/or trade-offs between the associated traits. In this study we compared the G-matrices of energy metabolism, life-history traits and morph production in 10 clonal lineages (genotypes) of the pea aphid, *Acyrthosiphon pisum*, during both sexual and asexual phases. The heritabilities (broad-sense) were significant for almost all traits in both phases; however the only significant genetic correlation we found was a positive correlation between resting metabolic rate and production of winged parthenogenetic females during the asexual phase. These results suggest the pea aphid shows some lineage specialization in terms of energy costs, but a higher specialization in the production of the different morphs (e.g., winged parthenogenetic females). Moreover, the production of winged females during the asexual phase appears to be more costly than wingless females. Finally, the structures of genetic variance-covariance matrices differed between both phases. These differences were mainly due to the correlation between resting metabolic rate and winged parthenogenetic females in the asexual phase. This structural difference would be indicating that energy allocation rules changes between phases, emphasizing the dispersion role of asexual morphs.","tags":["Cyclic parthenogenesis","G-matrix","Aphids","Energetic costs"],"title":"Short-term consequences of reproductive mode variation on the genetic architecture of energy metabolism and life-history traits in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto F Nespolo","Claudio Verdugo","Pablo Cortés García","Leonardo Bacigalupe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1266451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1266451200,"objectID":"014c32e6673bdbcbd0ab14f10d673d2e","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/2010_cortes-et-al/","publishdate":"2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_cortes-et-al/","section":"publication","summary":"Torpor is the physiologically controlled reduction of metabolic rate and body temperature experienced by small birds and mammals when facing periods of low temperature and/or food shortage. In this study, we provide a first quantitative description of torpor in the relict marsupial *Dromiciops gliroides* by (1) characterizing body temperature (T (B)) and torpor patterns, (2) evaluating the combined effects of ambient temperature and different levels of food restriction on torpor incidence and (3) exploring the metabolic depression during torpor. *D. gliroides* exhibited short bouts of torpor on a daily basis, during which T (B) decreased close to ambient temperature. During the active phase, T (B) also exhibited pronounced variation (range 34-38 degrees C). In order to evaluate the consistency of torpor, we computed the repeatability of T (B). Using the whole dataset, repeatability was significant (tau = 0.28). However, when torpid individuals were excluded from the analysis, repeatability was non-significant, some individuals were more prone to experience torpor than others. Our results indicate that this species also exhibits short bouts of daily torpor, whose depth and duration depends on the joint effects of T (A) and food availability. At T (A) = 20 degrees C, the maximum torpor incidence was found at 70-80% food reduction, while at both extremes of the food continuum (100 and 0-10% food reduction) individuals were completely active, although considerable variation in T (B) was recorded. At T (A) = 10 degrees C, individuals developed a deep form of torpor that was independent of the amount of food provided. On average, torpid *D. gliroides* reduced their metabolic rate up to 92% of their active values. In general, our results suggest that T (A) was the most immediate determinant of torpor, followed by energy availability.","tags":["Thermoregulation","Repeatability","Energetics","Marsupial"],"title":"Bioenergetics of torpor in the Microbiotherid marsupial, Monito del Monte (Dromiciops gliroides), the role of temperature and food availability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Cortés García","Silvia A Quijano","Roberto F Nespolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1231977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1231977600,"objectID":"81d97b1553df9369f5ed6293291960a2","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/2009_cortes-et-al/","publishdate":"2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_cortes-et-al/","section":"publication","summary":"In evolutionary physiology, studies of inter-individual variation (i.e. repeatability) in functional capacities are valuable as they indicate –within populations – what attributes could respond to natural selection. Although repeatability and quantitative genetics of physiological traits in energy metabolism of eutherian mammals have been well characterized, few or no studies have been performed on marsupials. We studied the repeatability (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient, τ) of bioenergetics for Monito del Monte (*Dromiciops gliroides*), the sole living representative of an otherwise extinct marsupial order (Microbiotheria). We measured resting metabolic rate as CO2 production(V̇CO2) and O2 consumption(V̇O2)simultaneously, together with minimum thermal conductance (C), evaporative water loss (EWL) and respiratory quotient (RQ), in a sample of ca. 20 individuals. Our results suggest that *D. gliroides* exhibits poor control of body temperature (Tb), with a thermal amplitude of ca. 10°C in normothermia. As a consequence, repeatability of Tb and metabolic rate (either as V̇CO2 or V̇O2) were relatively low (τTb=0.25±0.04,τ VCO2=0.14±0.03,τ V̇O2=0.24±0.02,jackknife estimations of standard errors). Thermal conductance exhibited near-zero or negative repeatability and was lower than expected for marsupials. However, we found significant repeatability for RQ and EWL(τ=0.32±0.03 and 0.49±0.09, respectively). In general, these results suggest that Monito del Monte exhibits some `reptilian' physiological characteristics. The relatively low repeatability of physiological variables,which otherwise exhibit large inter-individual and genetic variance in eutherian mammals, suggests that these capacities do not exhibit evolutionary potential in the ancient order Microbiotheria.","tags":["Metabolic rate","Endothermy","Repeatability","Marsupial"],"title":"Bioenergetics and inter-individual variation in physiological capacities in a relict mammal, the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
